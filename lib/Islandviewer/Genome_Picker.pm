# Check the min and max single cutoff thresholds, to ensure

# original code why this is important:
#
#Setting a maxmimum distance that at least one genome has to be within
#This is to ensure that the POSITIVE DATASET is searching for events on a similar time scale
#Decreasing this will reduce our positive dataset
#
#Setting a minimum distance that at least one genome has to be over
#This is to ensure that the NEGATIVE DATASET is finding old enough conserved regions
#Increasing this will reduce our negative dataset
#
# The way we're going to do this is by comparing against the set of
# picked candidate genomes, this way the comparison gets smaller every
# cycle and we can reuse this code to check within the trimming loop
#
# And because we're using this routing in our pull_a_thread we need
# the ability to exclude a particular candidate genome, hence the
